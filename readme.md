JustPlayMusic
=============

Preliminary work on an idea for a program to let users interact with YouTube like a dedicated music service, similar to Spotify, Pandora, or iTunes.

To try out the current prototype download and compile the files in src. Run the program and enter any search query into the text field, then click *GO*.  This will return a list of the top 10 videos that match the query from YouTube.  Click on one of the results to automatically open the video in a new tab in your default web browser.
